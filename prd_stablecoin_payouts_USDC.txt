PRD: Stablecoin Payouts (USDC) – Deel 
1. Executive Summary
Deel will introduce a “Get Paid in Crypto” feature that enables employees worldwide to receive payroll in USDC. Employers can offer it as an optional payout method without needing deep blockchain expertise. Employees will benefit from instant, low-cost, globally accessible payouts that integrate seamlessly with Deel’s existing hosted wallet/debit card experience. This feature strengthens Deel’s differentiation in the payroll space and builds credibility with web3-native talent.

2. Problem / Context
Overview
Employees in many regions (LatAm, Africa, SE Asia) face inflation, unstable currencies, and costly/slow banking systems.


Employers want to provide flexible payout options without the complexity of managing crypto infrastructure.


Deel already provides a hosted wallet and debit card experience. Expanding it to stablecoins requires minimal user friction.


Impact
Employees gain faster, cheaper access to funds in a stable asset (USDC).


Employers increase attractiveness to global talent by offering modern payout options.


Deel enhances competitive position versus Rippling, Papaya, and traditional payroll systems.



3. Users
Primary
Payroll Ops Managers (Employer-side): configure payout options, ensure compliance, execute payroll runs.


Employees: opt into USDC, manage wallets, withdraw/spend.


Secondary
CFO / FP&A: oversee cash management, ensure reporting compliance.


Regulators / Auditors: require transparent, auditable records.


Deel Internal Ops: handle integrations with custody/treasury providers.



4. Goals & Non-Goals
Goals
Let employers easily enable crypto payouts within existing payroll flows.


Provide hosted wallet functionality for employees (no self-custody required).


Ensure payouts are compliant (KYC/AML) and auditable.


Enable conversion between USDC → fiat (cash-out to bank or debit card).


Deliver POC quickly with mocked backend + AI-assisted coding.


Non-Goals
Supporting all cryptocurrencies (scope: USDC only).


Building proprietary custody tech (use existing providers/partners).


Providing yield/interest-bearing stablecoins in v1.


Deep FX/treasury automation (future scope).
